## Introduction

patterns like Redux are complex. Stepping back and bringing things back to simple categories can help in understanding the underlying plumbing.
This repository demonstrates in nodeJs with typescript (by making use of ts-node) how following Redux building blocks play together:
* a store
* actions
* reducers

The sample how both a non-rx and a rx implementation.

## Installation
```sh
npm install -g ts-node
npm install -g typescript
npm install
```
## Running the project
```sh
npm start
```

## using the real redux package
There is an additional branch use-redux-package, which does with minimal change the same stuff but with the real redux package.
